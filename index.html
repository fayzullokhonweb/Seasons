            Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate
            seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various
            technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies
            according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring
            in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere
            and vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights
            are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing
            and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the
            Summer Solstice in June (Northern Hemisphere) and December (Southern
            Hemisphere).

          <p class="season__text">
            Summer is the hottest and brightest of the four temperate seasons,
            occurring after spring and before autumn. At or centred on the
            summer solstice, daylight hours are longest and darkness hours are
            shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after
            the solstice. The earliest sunrises and latest sunsets also occur
            near the date of the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer
            varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is
            summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern
            Hemisphere, and vice versa.

          <p class="season__text">
            Autumn, also known as fall in North American English,[1] is one of
            the four temperate seasons on Earth. Outside the tropics, autumn
            marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern
            Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season
            when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the
            temperature cools considerably. Day length decreases and night
            length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice
            in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere).
            One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking
            change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare
            to shed.

          <p class="season__text">
            Winter is the coldest and darkest season of the year in polar and
            temperate climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. The
            tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere
            is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
            dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on
            weather.
